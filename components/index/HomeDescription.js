                        Mediation is unique in that it can be as creative as the participating parties choose to make it.
                        It is never an all-or-nothing negotiation.
                        What you get out of your session will be equivalent and representative to what you choose to put into it.

                        The mediatorâ€™s role is to provide a safe and neutral environment and a platform on which all involved parties are free to give background, storytell, express themselves and successfully reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
